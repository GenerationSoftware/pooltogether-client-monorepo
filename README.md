---

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styles
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

---

### Adding New Network

1. Update the `constants.ts` file in `utilities` with values and addresses for the new network.
2. Make sure the `usePublicClients` and `usePublicClientsByChain` hooks in `hyperstructure-react-hooks` include the new network.
3. Update the `config.ts` file and ENVs for any app you want to use this new network on.
4. Optionally add any token logo overrides in the `constants.ts` file in the `react-components` package.

### Wallet Support

Want your wallet in any of our apps? We rely on [RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/) and [WAGMI](https://wagmi.sh) for wallet connection. If you have a suitable [wallet connector](https://github.com/rainbow-me/rainbowkit/tree/main/packages/rainbowkit/src/wallets/walletConnectors) we can add your wallet and give you a custom link to highlight your wallet for your users.

Append `?wallet=<wallet key>` to any app's links to highlight your wallet. Keys are visible on each app's `config.ts` file. Example: [App Config](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pooltogether-client-monorepo/blob/main/apps/app/src/constants/config.ts).

### Known Issues / Fixes

When adding/updating apps and/or packages, duplicate dependencies may be created, creating versioning issues. This can be resolved through running `pnpm up -r` as described [here](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/2443), or just looking through `pnpm-lock.yaml` to identify version discrepancies.

The biggest culprit of the above is `@tanstack/react-query`, which sometimes is installed as two different versions and apps can no longer utilize hooks from the hooks package. This has been solved through the method described [here](https://github.com/TanStack/query/issues/3595#issuecomment-1248074333).

If editing component themes in `ui`, having the `Tailwind CSS IntelliSense` plugin for VSCode is recommended. In order to enable it for custom Flowbite themes and string class names, add `theme` and `.*ClassName*` to the `Class Attributes` setting.
